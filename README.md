### Risk-Assessment

A shiny application for eliciting expert opinion.  The application allows the user to choose 
between a continuous (Beta) or discrete (multinomial) probability distribution.  The results of 
the user input are stored in a google sheet and fed back to the user for viewing.  

The app is intended to be hosted, but can be run locally.  Several methods of running the script 
locally are detailed in the script Run_Locally.R.
